## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: Modern Chat Interface Design
The system SHALL provide a modern, visually appealing chat interface with glassmorphism effects, gradients, and micro-interactions that follows 2024 design trends.

#### Scenario: Modern visual design
- **WHEN** user views the chat interface
- **THEN** the interface displays glassmorphism effects, subtle gradients, and modern typography with proper visual hierarchy

#### Scenario: Vertical space optimization
- **WHEN** user accesses the interface
- **THEN** the layout utilizes 80% of the vertical screen space efficiently

#### Scenario: Micro-interactions
- **WHEN** user interacts with buttons, inputs, or messages
- **THEN** appropriate hover effects, transitions, and micro-animations provide visual feedback

### Requirement: Enhanced Color System
The system SHALL use a modern color palette with gradients and glassmorphism effects instead of basic flat colors.

#### Scenario: Gradient backgrounds
- **WHEN** user views the interface
- **THEN** subtle gradients are applied to backgrounds and key elements

#### Scenario: Glassmorphism effects
- **WHEN** user views chat messages and containers
- **THEN** glassmorphism effects with backdrop blur and transparency are applied

### Requirement: Improved Typography and Spacing
The system SHALL use modern typography scales and improved spacing for better visual hierarchy.

#### Scenario: Typography hierarchy
- **WHEN** user views different text elements
- **THEN** clear typography hierarchy with appropriate font weights and sizes is displayed

#### Scenario: Consistent spacing
- **WHEN** user views the interface
- **THEN** consistent spacing system is applied throughout all components

### Requirement: Enhanced Dark Mode
The system SHALL provide an improved dark mode experience with modern color schemes and proper contrast ratios.

#### Scenario: Dark mode toggle
- **WHEN** user enables dark mode
- **THEN** the interface switches to a modern dark color scheme with proper contrast ratios

#### Scenario: System preference detection
- **WHEN** user has system dark mode enabled
- **THEN** the interface automatically adapts to the system preference

### Requirement: Performance-Optimized Animations
The system SHALL include smooth, performance-optimized animations and transitions.

#### Scenario: Smooth transitions
- **WHEN** user interacts with interface elements
- **THEN** smooth transitions and animations are displayed without performance impact

#### Scenario: Reduced motion support
- **WHEN** user has reduced motion preferences enabled
- **THEN** animations are disabled or simplified to respect accessibility preferences
